# Movie-Recommendation-System-_DataBase
1. Database Planning:
Goal: The goal of database planning is to organize the information that the movie recommendation system will use and store. The system needs a well-structured database to handle and manage all the data related to users, movies, ratings, and recommendations in an efficient way.
Key Parts:
•	User Information: This includes users’ basic information, such as their email, preferences, and usernames, which will be saved in the Users table.
•	Movies: The Movies table will store movie details like title, release year, description, cast, and runtime.
•	Ratings: The Ratings table will store how users rate movies, along with the time they rated the movie and any reviews they provide.
•	Genres: The Genres table will store different movie genres and their popularity.
•	Viewing History: The Viewing History table will keep track of what movies users have watched, including when they watched them, for how long, and on which device.
•	Recommendations: The Recommendations table will store the movie suggestions generated for each user.
Features for Planning:
•	Tracking User Preferences: The system will save what movies users like and their ratings, so it can give better recommendations.
•	Personalized Movie Suggestions: It will recommend movies based on the movies that users have watched and rated highly.
•	Genre Browsing: Users can explore movies by genre to find more options.
•	Auto Spelling Correction: The system will fix common spelling errors when users enter data, making it more accurate.
•	Sharing Recommendations: Users can share their favorite movies with friends.
•	Real-Time Updates: The system will update recommendations and data based on what the user does, keeping everything current.
2. System Definition:

3. Requirement Collection and Analysis:
Methods for Gathering Information:
1.	Interviews: 
o	Interviews were conducted with potential users, both movie lovers and casual viewers.
o	Findings: Users wanted personalized recommendations based on their preferences, easy browsing, and a way to rate movies.
2.	Questionnaires: 
o	A survey was shared with users to understand their movie-watching habits and preferences.
o	Findings: Most respondents enjoy watching action and animated movies. They also wanted a system that could suggest movies based on ratings from other users.
3.	User Observation: 
o	Observing how people interact with current movie platforms helped to spot frustrations and difficulties in finding movies.
o	Findings: Users spend a lot of time scrolling through long lists without finding what they like and often rely on external reviews.
Key Requirements:
•	User Needs: Users want personalized movie suggestions, an easy way to search for movies, and a way to share recommendations.
•	System Features: The system should have user profiles, a recommendation engine, real-time updates, and auto-correction for misspelled inputs.
•	Data Management: A solid database design is needed to store and manage all the information about users, movies, ratings, and movie-watching history.
4. Database Design:
Entities and Attributes:
1.	User: This stores user-related data like user-id, email, preferences, username, and profile picture.
2.	Movie: This stores movie details, including movie-id, title, release year, description, and cast.
3.	Rating: This keeps track of ratings, linking users and movies. It includes rating-id, user-id, movie-id, rating value, and timestamp.
4.	Genres: This tracks genres and includes genre-id, genre name, description, and popularity score.
5.	Viewing History: This table stores information on what movies users have watched, when, on what device, and for how long.
6.	Recommendations: This table stores the movies suggested to each user, along with the recommendation score and timestamp.
Relationships:
•	User and Ratings: One user can give ratings for many movies, and each rating is linked to a single user.
•	Movie and Ratings: Many users can rate one movie, and each rating is tied to a single movie.
•	User and Viewing History: A user can have many records in the viewing history, and each record is connected to a single user.
•	Movie and Viewing History: A movie can be viewed by many users, and each viewing is logged separately.
•	User and Recommendations: A user can get many movie recommendations.
•	Movie and Recommendations: A movie can be recommended to multiple users.
•	User and Movie: Many users can watch the same movie, and each user can watch many movies.
•	Movie and Genre: Movies can belong to several genres, and genres can include many movies.
•	User and Genre: A user can have preferences for multiple genres, and genres can be liked by many users.
5. Application Design:
Features of the Application:
•	User Interface (UI): The application will have an easy-to-use interface where users can manage their profiles, browse movies by genre, rate films, and view recommendations.
•	Recommendation System: The system will use algorithms to suggest movies based on the user’s history, ratings, and preferences.
•	Database Interaction: The application will pull data from the database to show personalized recommendations, movie details, and ratings.
Design Considerations:
•	The interface will be simple and intuitive, so users can easily navigate through the system.
•	Recommendations will be updated automatically as the user watches and rates movies.
•	Users will be able to share their movie suggestions on social platforms or within the system.
6. DBMS Selection:
Criteria for Choosing the Right DBMS:
•	Scalability: The database system should be able to handle an increasing amount of data as the user base grows.
•	Data Integrity: The system must ensure that the data stored (such as ratings and user information) is consistent and accurate.
•	Performance: The DBMS should provide fast access to data, especially when retrieving personalized recommendations.
•	Compatibility: It should work well with the application to ensure smooth integration.
Recommended DBMS:
•	MySQL: A relational database management system, perfect for handling structured data with many relationships, which is ideal for this project. It’s fast, scalable, and supports complex queries.
7. Prototyping:
Goal of Prototyping: The prototyping phase involves building an early version of the system to demonstrate its functionality and gather feedback for improvements.
Prototype Features:
•	User Profile Management: Users can create and manage their profiles, updating preferences and viewing history.
•	Movie Recommendations: A system that suggests movies based on the user’s previous activity and ratings.
•	Rating System: Users can rate movies they’ve watched and see other users' ratings.
•	Genre Browsing: Users can explore movies by their preferred genres.
•	Social Sharing: Users can share their favorite movie recommendations with friends.
Prototype Goals:
•	Test the User Interface: Ensure the interface is easy to use and navigable.
•	Validate Recommendations: Make sure the recommendations are relevant to users based on their viewing history and ratings.
•	Gather Feedback: Collect user feedback on the prototype to refine the system before fully developing it.
